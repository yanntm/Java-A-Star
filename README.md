This port to Java by Yann Thierry-Mieg, based off of  :

https://github.com/yanntm/YoBot/blob/master/Astar.cpp

The intention is to be a small standalone Java implementation that is easy to adapt to new use cases.

The code is more general than the use of it done in the main ; in particular we only consider walls or empty spaces in the grid when the algorithm supports arbitrary costs.
